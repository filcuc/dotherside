C language library for creating bindings for the Qt QML language.

Documentation: https://filcuc.github.io/dotherside/

Currently the DOtherSide library is used by the following bindings:
* [nimqml](https://github.com/filcuc/nimqml), QML bindings for the Nim programming language
* [qml_zig](https://github.com/kassane/qml_zig), QML bindings for the Zig programming language

It was historically used by: 
* [dqml](https://github.com/filcuc/dqml), QML bindings for the D programming language
* [qml-rust](https://github.com/White-Oak/qml-rust), QML bindings for the Rust programming language

## Supported features
The following features are implementable from a binding language
* Creation of custom QObject
* Creation of custom QAbstractItemModels (Lists, Tables and Trees)
* Creation of custom properties, signals and slots
* Creation of QObjects from QML
* Registration of singletons in QML
* Creation of custom image providers

Currently we provide the prebuilt binaries for Windows through the
GitHub [releases](https://github.com/filcuc/DOtherSide/releases) page
or directly as artifacts from Github actions

* Linux: gcc 4.8 or later with c++11 support or higher
* Windows: Visual Studio 2013|2015 Community Edition (Windows) or higher

## Build instructions:
```
cd /path/to/cloned/repo
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Install Instructions
Once you built the package just type
```
make install
```
by default cmake will install to the default CMAKE prefix.
If you want to customize this location type the following command
during the build steps when invoking cmake
```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path/to/install/prefix path/to/CMakeLists.txt
```
